2. Configure Azure authentication for real Azure services
3. Implement actual MCP server connections
4. Connect to your monitoring and logging systems

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Streamlit with Plotly charts
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation
- **Visualization**: Plotly Express and Graph Objects
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for enhanced UI
- **Real-time Updates**: Session state management

## Azure Integration

The dashboard is designed to integrate with Azure services:
- Azure OpenAI Service
- Azure Cognitive Services
- Azure Monitor
- Azure Cost Management
- Azure Security Center

Follow Azure best practices for authentication and security when connecting to real services.
