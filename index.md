“Preparing for SkyNet”

OWASP hactu8 builds on OWASP’s foundational IoT and LLM security projects to create an active security testing platform for robotics, IoT, and consumer electronics. It leverages existing resources like the OWASP IoT Top 10, OWASP IoT Security Testing Guide, and OWASP LLM projects to provide practical, hands-on tools for ethical hackers and security professionals.

The integration of generative AI (LLMs) transforms traditional security workflows by offering automated vulnerability detection, test script generation, and AI-powered exploitation guidance. Furthermore, the platform actively mitigates risks unique to LLMs (e.g., adversarial prompts, data exposure) by aligning with OWASP LLM security principles.

OWASP hactu8 serves as both a learning environment and a practical testing tool, enabling the community to collaboratively secure the future of robotics and IoT in the age of AI.

### Road Map
Phase 1: Foundation and Integration

* Evaluate OWASP IoT and OWASP LLM projects to align methodologies and tools.
* Develop an initial proof-of-concept platform integrating OWASP IoT Security Testing Guide and OWASP LLM Security Project.
* Create a basic AI-powered vulnerability testing module.

Phase 2: Platform Development

* Build the full platform with:
	•	Modular tools for fuzzing, firmware analysis, and API security testing.
	•	Generative AI-driven testing and reporting capabilities.
* Add real-world test scenarios for robotics and IoT, with specific cases for cloud-hosted AI.
* Integrate OWASP LLM Security recommendations to address AI-specific risks.

Phase 3: Community Engagement and Expansion

* Release the platform as an open-source tool for community testing and contributions.
* Host workshops, webinars, and collaborative hackathons focused on securing LLM-integrated systems and IoT.
* Add API integrations to expand the platform’s extensibility with external tools.
